  <h1>Implementing OHDSI on Databricks Using Broadsea</h1>
  This guide will walk through the creation of a new OHDSI stack using 
  <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/Broadsea">Broadsea</a> and using Databricks for the CDM on Windows. 
  This guide assumes that you have Docker installed and a CDM instance you can point to in Databricks. 
  <br/>
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  Before you get started, make sure you do not have a local instance of PostgreSql running as a service. 
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  To get started, it's not a bad idea to clear out your Docker instance. 
  The two scripts below can be run from PowerShell. 
  The first script will delete all volumes, containers, and images from your Docker instance. 
  The second script will show you if there are any volumes, containers, or images remaining in your Docker instance.
  <br/>
  <a href="img/developer-how-tos/broadsea/scripts/clean-docker.sh">clean-docker.sh</a>
  <br/>
  <a href="img/developer-how-tos/broadsea/scripts/show-docker.bat">show-docker.bat</a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clean script will launch a bash window and ask for comfimation that you really want to delete everything.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show script can be used to confirm there's nothing left on Docker.

  <h3>Clone Broadsea</h3>
  Clone Broadsea using: 
  <br/>
  <pre class="prescrollable">git clone https://github.com/OHDSI/Broadsea</pre>
  <h3>Copy the Spark JDBC Jar File and Update the docker-compose.yml file</h3>
  Paste a copy of the spark JDBC driver you are using into your Broadsea directory 
  (the directory that has the docker-compose.yml file)
  Replace the existing docker-compose.yml file with this 
  <a download href="img/developer-how-tos/broadsea/scripts/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file. 
  (I usually backup the original as shown below). 
  This new docker-compose.yml file simply adds the following lines to the ohdsi-webapi-from-image section.
<pre class="prescrollable">
    volumes:
      - ./SparkJDBC42.jar:/var/lib/ohdsi/webapi/WEB-INF/lib/SparkJDBC42.jar
</pre>
  <br/>
  The Spark JDBC driver and new docker-compose.yml file should now be in the root directory of the Broadsea project as shown below.

  <h3>Start Broadsea</h3>
  Start Broadsea in the ususal way. 
  Open a cmd prompt, navigate to the Broadsea directory and execute 
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
docker compose pull && docker-compose --profile default up -d
</pre>
  <h3>Connect Your Databricks CDM to OHDSI Using Ponos bs-init</h3>    
  Use the following cmd from the location where you installed Ponos to connect your Databricks CDM to OHDSI.  
<pre class="pre-scrollable">

</pre>
