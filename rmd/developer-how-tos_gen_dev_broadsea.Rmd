  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  This guide will walk through the creation of a new OHDSI stack using 
  <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/Broadsea">Broadsea</a> and using Databricks for the CDM on Windows. 
  This guide assumes that you have Docker installed and a CDM instance you can point to in Databricks.

  <h3>Shutdown PostgreSql</h3>
  Before you get started, make sure you do not have a local instance of PostgreSql running as a service.

  <h3>Start Docker</h3>
  If you do not have Docker Desktop you can download and install it from 
  <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/</a>. 
  Start Docker Desktop from either the short cut if it was installed 
  or from the Windows search menu.

  <h3>Clean Docker</h3>
  To get started, it's not a bad idea to clear out your Docker instance. 
  The two scripts below can be run from PowerShell. 
  The first script will delete all volumes, containers, and images from your Docker instance. 
  The second script will show you if there are any volumes, containers, or images remaining in your Docker instance.
  <br/>
  <a href="img/developer-how-tos/broadsea/scripts/clean-docker.sh">clean-docker.sh</a>
  <br/>
  <a href="img/developer-how-tos/broadsea/scripts/show-docker.bat">show-docker.bat</a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clean script will launch a bash window and ask for comfimation that you really want to delete everything.

  <br/>
  The show script can be used to confirm there's nothing left on Docker.

  <h3>Confirm Docker is Running</h3>
  After Docker has been started and cleaned you should see something like what is shown below in Docker Desktop.

  <!-- * * *

  * CLONE FROM GITHUB

  <h3>Clone Broadsea from Github</h3>
  Clone Broadsea using: 
  <br/>
  <pre class="prescrollable">git clone https://github.com/OHDSI/Broadsea</pre>
  <!-- * * *
  *
  * START BROADSEA
  *
  * * * -->
  <h3>Start Broadsea</h3>
  Start Broadsea in the ususal way. 
  Open a cmd prompt, navigate to the Broadsea directory and execute 
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
docker compose pull && docker-compose --profile default up -d
</pre>
  
  <h3>Confirm Broadsea</h3>
  When Broadsea is running you should see something like what is shown below in the Docker Desktop application. 
  <br/>

  <!--

  * RESTART DOCKER AND LAUNCH ATLAS
  *

  <h3>Restart Docker and Launch Atlas</h3>
  Restart Docker:
<pre class="prescrollable">
docker compose --profile default down 
docker compose pull && docker-compose --profile default up -d
</pre> 
  <br/>
  Open <a href="http://127.0.0.1/atlas">http://127.0.0.1/atlas</a> in a browser and navigate to Data Sources. 
  Select your data source (in this case "Databricks Demo" and then select a report, the Person report is shown in the screen shot below). 
  When you do this you should not see any errors in the Docker output for webapi as shown below.
