<h2>Introduction</h2>
This document provides a complete example of how to run a Strategus study using the Strategus client Ergasia 
<nobr>(<a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/ergasia">https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/ergasia</a>).</nobr>
<!--
*
* Identify CDM data source
*
-->

<h2>Identify or create CDM</h2>
Before starting, identify the datasource to be used as the CDM. 
If you do not have a data source, 
you can create an instance of the Eunomia CDM 
by following the instructions in the 
<a href="./developer-how-tos_ohdsi-on-databricks.html">OHDSI on databricks guide</a> 
in the "Create a test instance of the CDM in Databricks" section.  

<!--
*
* Installation of R and RTools
*
-->

<h2>Installation of R and RTools</h2>
R 4.2.3 and RTools 4.2 are used here. 
These are the versions that were used for testing and validation. 
<p>
R 4.2.3 can be downloaded from 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/</a>. 
<br/>
RTools 4.2 can be downloaded from 
<nobr><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html</a></nobr> 
</p>
<p>
Or the windows installer for each can be directly downloaded here:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2ao0wbi49ic19jcxk8lf0/R-4.2.3-win.exe?rlkey=3qlk90ugzx7q9ym2z3yjqmhl5&dl=1">R 4.2.3</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a download href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1xi8asmak0u6foi6b5mgc/rtools42-5355-5357.exe?rlkey=r0psxd9e5gv1vk8rkm7pasmad&dl=1">RTools 4.2</a>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

After downloading the installers perform these steps in order:
<ul>
  <li>Run the R installer executable.</li> 
  <li>Set the LibPath as described below.</li>  
  <li>Then run the RTools installer.</li>
</ul>

<!--
*
* Set LibPaths
*
-->

<h2>Set LibPaths</h2>
Strategus uses the .libPaths() setting shown below. 
In order for libriaries to all be placed in the correct place, 
the default for .libPaths() needs to be set. 
Edit the .Renviron file by running the following.  
<pre class="r">
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
edit_r_environ()
</pre>
Add the following line to your .Renviron file.  
<pre class="r">
R_LIBS_USER="C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.3/library"
</pre>

<!--
*
* Download Client
*
-->

<h2>Download Client</h2>
To run our Strategus study we will be using a Strategus client called Ergasia 
(named after the Greek god of light work... or so I've been told by ChatGPT). 
Clone the project and check out the desired version as shown below 
(this documentation was created for the v0.0.1 version). 

<pre class="r">
git clone https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/ergasia
cd ergasia
git checkout v0.0.1
</pre>

<p>
  Note that the Ergasia project is somewhat object oriented. 
  Files are best browsed in a tool that supports file browsing a little bit better than RStudio. 
  Here, we will be using Visual Studio Code (VSC) to browse files and RStudio to execute code. 
</p>


<!--

* Download Client

-->

<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
  Strategus (an R in general) has requirements for version configuration. 
  Before we can run our study, we need to make sure we have the correct libraries 
  and the correct versions of these libraries installed. 
  This can be done by simply running the Bootstrap.R script found in ./_StartHere/Bootstrap. 
  Open this script in RStudio and execute the entire script (e.g. <Shift><Ctrl><Enter>). 
  This will install the correct version of all of the required R libraries. 
  This script can be run multiple times (install is skipped if the correct version is found).

<!--
*
* Testing Resources
*
-->

<h2>Testing Resources</h2>
<p>
  The Ergasia project includes everything required to run included test studies... 
  except for the connection details for the CDM database connection. 
  Future releases will include connection details to a default install of Braodsea. 
  To run a test study, simply create your CDM connection details (as described below),  
  edit the ./_StartHere/Configuration/configuration.json file (as described below), 
  and then run ./_StartHere/01-RunStudies.R script. 
</p>

<!--
*
* Resources and Configuration
*
-->

<h2>Resources and Configuration</h2>
<p>
  All of the resources you will normally need to run a study are in the _StartHere folder 
  including all of the configurations you will need to edit or otherwise define. 
</p>
<p>
  To run a study, we will need the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Connection Details for the reporting database (postgres)</li>
    <li>Connection Details for the CDM</li>
    <li>The Strategus study definitions for the studies you are going to run</li>
    <li>A configuration file that pulls everything together</li>
  </ul>
  Details for each of these are given individually below. 
  Test/example versions of each of these are provided except for the CDM database details. 
  There is an example given and you sould be able to create your own based on this example. 
  The example CDM connection details are for a Databricks database and use the keyring pattern defined in the 
  <a href="./developer-how-tos_gen_dev_keyring.html">key ring example</a>.
  Location of these resources is shown below.

<h3>Connection Details: Reporting</h3>
<p>
  Connection details for your reporting (postgres) instance can be configured by editing:
  <br/>
  ./_StartHere/ConnectionDetails/Results/ConnectionDetailsForResults.R
  <br/>
  The contents of the existing ConnectionDetailsForCdm.R file are shown below. 
<pre class="pre-scrollable" height="100">

ConnectionDetailsForResults <- {}

ConnectionDetailsForResults$createConnectionDetails <- function() {
  resultsDatabaseConnectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
    dbms = "postgresql",
    connectionString = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/STRAT_RESULTS?user=postgres&password=ohdsi&currentSchema=STRAT_RESULTS",
    pathToDriver = "D:/_YES/databases/postgres/drivers/42.3.3"
  )
  return(resultsDatabaseConnectionDetails)
}

<h3>Strategus Study Definition</h3>
<p>
  The Ergasia project assumes you have created your Strategus study definition. 
  Study definitions that can be used for testing and validation 
  can be found in the ./_StartHere/Studies folder. 
  The process for creating a Strategus study is currently documented at 
  <a href="https://ohdsi.github.io/Strategus/articles/CreatingAnalysisSpecification.html">https://ohdsi.github.io/Strategus/articles/CreatingAnalysisSpecification.html</a>

  <h3>Parameter Details</h3>
  This section describes the parameters defined in the ./_StartHere/Configuration/configuration.json file. 
  The next section ("Run Studies") will describe the end to end process to run a study.   

  <!-- libPath -->
  <h4>libPath</h4>
  This parameter is no longer used and is in the process of being refactored out. 
  
  <!-- dbms -->
  <h4>dbms</h4>
  The dmbs of your CDM (e.g. "spark", "postgres", etc.
  
  <!-- resultsDatabaseName -->
  <h4>resultsDatabaseName</h4>
  This is the name of the Postgres Database where the results will be stored. 
  This database needs to be created before running a study. 
  
  <!-- outputDir -->
  <h4>outputDir</h4>
  The root directory where the study results will be written.  
  
  <!-- logDir -->
  <h4>logDir</h4>
  The directory where logging output will be directed. 
  
  <!-- pathToDriver -->
  <h4>pathToDriver</h4>
  The path to where the jdbc driver for your Postgres database can be found. 
  This diretory should only contain the driver and no other files. 
  
  <!-- cdmschema -->
  <h4>cdmSchema</h4>
  The name of the schema that contains the CDM to be used for the study. 
  
  <!-- workSchema -->
  <h4>workSchema</h4>
  This is a schema in the same dbms system that will be used as a workspace by Strategus. 
  This schema needs to be created before running a study. 
  
  <!-- dbms -->
  <h4>tempSchema</h4>
  This is a schema in the same dbms system that will be used as a workspace by Strategus. 
  This schema needs to be created before running a study. 
  
  <!-- dbms -->
  <h4>resultsSchemaPrefix</h4>
  This is used to name the schema where the results of a study will be store. 
  For example, if we run the study called "andreas" (described below), 
  the results of the run will be written to a schema called "demo_andreas". 
  
  <!-- dbms -->
  <h4>cohortTableName</h4>
  Strategus needs this. Pick a name that make sense to you. 
  I have not yet needed to access this table (i.e. it seems to be used primarily internally). 
  
  <!-- lists -->
  <h4>lists</h4>
  studyNameList, resultsFilter, and databseFilter are currently not used. 
  
  <!-- minCellCount -->
  <h4>minCellCount</h4>
  This is a value used to supress the creation of small sets of patients to protect privacy. 
  
  <!-- studiesToRun -->
  <h4>studiesToRun</h4>
  This is a list of the studies that will be run. 
  Each item in this list contains the name of the file that contains the Strategus definition for the study 
  and the name to be used for the study. 
  
</p>

<h2>Run A Study</h2>
In this section we will give a detailed description of each of the steps used to run a study. 
The following steps are described. 
<ul>
  <li>Create the Postgres Database to hold the results</li>
  <li>Create the work/temp schema in the same dbms as your CDM that will be used by Strategus</li>
  <li>Delete the remains of any previous run</li>
  <li>Initialize the R libraries (Bootstrap)</li>
  <li>Run the study</li>
  <li>Create the tables where the results will be stored</li>
  <li>Upload the results</li>
  <li>View the results</li>
</ul>

COMMING SOON :) :) :)
