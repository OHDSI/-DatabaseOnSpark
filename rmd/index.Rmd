<h2>Problem Space and Goals</h2>
<p>
  Databricks and Spark are new, quickly evolving data management systems (database, data lake, data warehouse) that can provide high performance solutions for large and very large data sets. 
  This group is dedicated to creating, documenting, supporting, and promoting OHDSI on Databricks/Spark. 
</p>
<p>
  Information is provided below on how to join our group.

  If you have specific OHDSI on Databricks/Spark issues or questions please reach out to us on the 
  <a href="https://forums.ohdsi.org/c/implementers/6">OHDSI Implementers Forum</a> and include "Databricks/Spark" in the topic of your post.
