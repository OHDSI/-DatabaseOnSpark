<h3>Introduction</h3>
<b>This is a one-time activity that will persist your credentials to your localhost permanently.</b> 
<br/>
<p>
More information is available at

We often need to provide credentials to access resources such as databases. 
Hardcoding these credentials is frowned upon as it could lead to these credentials being exposed 
(e.g. committed to GitHub). 
To protect this information, we can store passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information in a keyring 
using the keyring library. 
The code presented below is available in GitHub at 
<a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/r-keyring">https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/r-keyring</a>.

<h3>Store a value in a keyring</h3>
The following code shows the create_keyring function defined in the r-keyring project. 

<pre class="r">
# ---
#
# function to create a keyring
#
# ---

# installs
# install.packages("keyring")

# libraries
library(keyring)

# create the key ring
create_keyring <- function(kr_name, kr_service, kr_username) {
  kb <- keyring::backend_file$new()
  kb$keyring_create(kr_name)
  kb$set(kr_service, username = kr_username, keyring = kr_name)
  kb$keyring_lock(kr_name)
}
</pre>

When this code is call, you will be asked to enter a keyring password. 
This is the password that you use when you want to retrieve your password or token. 
In this example we use "foo". 
<br/>
<img width="350px" src="./img/gen-dev/keyring/01-keyring-password.png" />
<br/>

You will then be asked to enter a password. 
<br/>
<img width="350px" src="./img/gen-dev/keyring/02-user-password.png" />
<br/>

This is the password or token for your database. 
In this example we entered "asdf1098743n12lkjj5-MY_TOKEN-aoipuoi19087mnoipuasddf".
<br/>

After you have stored your password/token in the keyring it can be fetched using the code below. 
<pre class="r">
# get the password from the keyring
keyring::backend_file$new()$get(
  service = kr_service,
  user = kr_username,
  keyring = kr_name
)
</pre>
When you execute this code you will be asked for the password for the keyring (in this example we used "foo"). 

This code will output the following. 
<pre class="r">
&gt; # get the password from the keyring
&gt; keyring::backend_file$new()$get(
+   service = kr_service,
+   user = kr_username,
+   keyring = kr_name
+ )
[1] "asdf1098743n12lkjj5-MY_TOKEN-aoipuoi19087mnoipuasddf"
</pre>
<br/>
We can then use something like the following to securely create a url to connect to Databricks. 
<pre class="r">
#
# functions to get databricks token (user will be prompted for keyring password)
#

getToken <- function () {
  return (
    keyring::backend_file$new()$get(
      service = "databricks",
      user = "token",
      keyring = "databricks_keyring"
    )
  )
}

#
# functions to get databricks token (user will be prompted for keyring password)
#

getUrl <- function () {
  url <- "jdbc:databricks://nachc-databricks.cloud.databricks.com:443/default;transportMode=http;ssl=1;httpPath=sql/protocolv1/o/3956472157536757/0123-223459-leafy532;AuthMech=3;UseNativeQuery=1;UID=token;PWD="
  return (
    paste(url, getToken(), sep = "")
  )  
}
</pre>
