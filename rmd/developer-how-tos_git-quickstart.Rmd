			<h1>Git and Github Quickstart Guide</h1>
			This is the quick start guid for Git and Git hub.  
			Git is a version control system that is used by virtually all open source (and other large) projects.  
			This quick start guide shows how to download and install a Git client, 
			how to create a Github account,
			and how to get permissions for an existing Github project (like this one!).   
			<br/>

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			The following steps are detail below.  
			<ul>
				<li>Install a Git Client</li>
				<li>Create a Github Account</li>
				<li>Fork a Project</li>
				<li>Clone the Project</li>
				<li>Make Your Updates</li>
				<li>Commit Your Updates</li>
				<li>Create a Pull Request</li>
			</ul>

      <!-- 
      *
      * install a client
      *
      * -->

			<h2>Install a Git Client</h2>
			Instructions for installing a Git client are 
			<a target="gitclient" href = "./developer-how-tos-install-git-client.html">
				here
			</a>. 
			<br/>
			
      <!-- 
      *
      * create an account
      *
      * -->

			<h2>Create a Github Account</h2>
			Go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and select "Sign Up".  
			Follow the instructions there to create your Github account.

			<br/><br/>
			<p>
				Once you've created your account you can check your user name by selecting the icon in the upper right corner 
				and then selecting "Your Profile" (select the link at the bottom of the screen to skip the tutorial first).  
				Your user name should be on the left side of the screen.  
			</p>

      <!-- 
      *
      * fork a project
      *
      * -->

      <!-- 
      *
      * clone
      *
      * -->

			<h3>Clone the Repository</h3>
			<p>
			"Cloning" the repository just means pulling a copy of the files down to your local machine in a way that 
			any changes you make can be merged back into the repository.  
			</p>
			<p>
			After you've accepted the invitation you will be sent to the home page of the repository.  
			Copy the url.  
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<img width="600px" src="./img/developer-how-tos/git-quickstart/repository.png" />
			<br/><br/>
			<p>
				You'll want to follow the repository owners instructions for forking and branching, but for now, 
				lets just look at the case of working directly on the main branch of the existing (unforked) repository (which you should never do... ever).  
			</p>
			<p>
				Open a cmd prompt and navigate to the directory where you would like the project to live.  
			</p>
			<p>
				After you've install the client you will need to issue the following two commands (this is usually a one time thing).  
				<br/>
				git config --global user.email "the-email-you-registered-withc@yourhost.com"
				<br/>
				git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
			</p>
			<p>
				To clone the repository, enter the command:<br/>
				git clone &lt;paste-repository-name-here&gt;
			</p>

			<br/><br/>
			<h3>Make Your Updates and Commit</h3>
			Change to the directory that was downloaded from the clone process.  
			Make your updates to the files.  
			When you are done with your updates, commit the changes using the following Git commands. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			git add -A <br/>
			git commit -m "a very useful and meaningful message" <br/>
			git push origin <br/>
