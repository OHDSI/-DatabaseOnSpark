To join the OHDSI Databricks User Group sign up using the 
<a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lAAPoyCRq0q6TOVQkCOy1ZyG6Ud_r2tKuS0HcGnqiQZUOVJFUzBFWE1aSVlLN0ozR01MUVQ4T0RGNyQlQCN0PWcu">OHDSI Workgroups Sign Up page</a>. 
Sign up for the Open Source Community (the Databricks User Group is a subgroup of the Open Source Community).

When you launch MS Teams, you should see a list of the groups you are signed up for. 
If you do not see the list of groups you expected, check that you are using the email you signed up with 
and that you are in the correct OHDSI host (see red arrows in the image below). 
The Databricks Users Group is a sub-group of the Open Source work group (see red ovals on the left in the image below).
